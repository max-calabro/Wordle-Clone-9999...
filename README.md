### **_Description_**

#### This project was done as an exercise in coding a website to exact specifications that were not my own. When coding solo or small group projects I am in complete creative control over looks and functionallity and if something works and looks good it's considered done. But I wanted to create a project where I had no creative freedom and instead had to follow someone elses guidelines. Just because it works doesn't mean it is finished.
